# Void word combinator
Void it's a simple python3 program that generates all possible combinations of words and numbers. 
The main module that I used to write this program is [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/itertools.html). The module has a built-in function that combines. _The program is raw so I will add new features and fix bugs. But you can already use it_

## Using
1. Run program by typing ```python3 main.py```
2. Then select the first option from the menu.
3. Enter words amount (for example 2)
4. Enter the words one at a time in each line
5. When the process ends, in the file ```rawdata.txt``` all possible combinations will be recorded.
> Note: they will be saved in ```rawdata.txt``` as
> ('word1')
> ('word2')
> ('word1', 'word2')
> ('word2', 'word1')
> So if you need clean output that will only include the words - run the program again and select the second option from the menu
