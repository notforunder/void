# Void word combinator
Void it's a simple python3 program that generates all possible combinations of words and numbers. 
The main module that I used to write this program is [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/itertools.html). The module has a built-in function that combines. _The program is raw so I will add new features and fix bugs. But you can already use it_

## Using
```python3 main.py <input_file> <output_file>```

NOTE: In input file put words for each line

## Installation
```git clone https://github.com/notforunder/void```
```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
